# wodCZ/dotFeedr

Tiny weekend-project, inspired by http://agar.io/.

It's html5 absorb-game based on EaselJS framework.

Server-side is located at https://github.com/wodCZ/dotFeedrServer

## Todo
 - speed will need more complex algorithm - bigger should never be faster than slower
 - any deformation like in agar.io would be cool
 - ability to "attack" by splitting and forcing part against cursor
 - code-cleanup
 - integrate into server

## Extra Todo (features over agar.io)
 - ability to create account & sign in
 - extract some modifiers (speed, growth, ...)
 - add "coins"
 - ability to upgrade modifiers for those coins
 - some kind of minimap or pointer, so map would be bigger


## Disclaimer 

I'm PHP programmer, so code absolutely doesn't follow JS best-practices. I didn't want to build it beatifully clean from scratch, rather learn while coding.
Also, first commit messages are not great. I usually don't do this...
