Tiny weekend-project, inspired by http://agar.io/.
It's html5 absorb-game based on EaselJS framework.

Currently have ended at collisions â€“ detection is pretty slow, will need tweaks. 
Also this ends in about 10 secs, because mass is directly set as radius, so you absorb everything.

Next step is websocket server.
