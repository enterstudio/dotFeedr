Tiny weekend-project, inspired by http://agar.io/.

It's html5 absorb-game based on EaselJS framework.

## Todo
 - speed will need more complex algorithm
 - "eating" would not happen on collision, but on overlaying by more than 50% or so
 - any deformation like in agar.io would be cool
 - ability to "attack" by splitting and forcing part against cursor
 - websocket server that will handle food spawning and bubbles syncing
 - collision detection and handling would be moved to server


## Extra Todo (features over agar.io)
 - ability to create account & sign in
 - extract some modifiers (speed, growth, ...)
 - add "coins"
 - ability to upgrade modifiers for those coins
